These are the submission files for the second IOT task in the summer training offered by Smart Methods Co.

This project is concerned with creating a remote control panel for a robot where it provides 4 directional buttons and a stop button. Once the button is pressed, the value will be updated in the database where the robot retrieves the value and operate accordingly. The control panel (web page) is implemented in a moblie-friendly environment. 

The projects consist of the following main files:

bot-movement.html: this is the user interface of the control panel where the user can send move commands.

control.js: implements user-friendly features and functions to send the data to the host/server to be handled.

receiver.php: responsible to update the data in the database.

robot-page.php: the robot can use this page to retrieve the data from the database.
