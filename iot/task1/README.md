These are the submission files for the first IOT task in the summer training offered by Smart Methods Co.

This project is concerned with creating a control panel for a robot with 6-engines arm where each one needs to be set to be able to start the robot. After setting the robot engines, the user can issue a start command to the robot. As usual, the data set by the user will be saved and stored in a database where the robot can retrieve the data and operates correspondingly.

The projects consist of the following main files:

bot-control.html: the interface for the control panel where the user can set the engines' values.

control.js: implements user-friendly features and will send the data to the host/server to be handled.

ajax.php: responsible to update the data in the database.

robot-page.php: the robot can use this page to retrieve the data from the database, it's also human-readable.
